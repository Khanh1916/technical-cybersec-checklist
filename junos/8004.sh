# DESCRIPTION:
# This script validates network device firewall filter configuration
# following security requirements for access control to management services
#
# VALIDATION LOGIC:
# 1. Check if configuration file exists and is accessible
# 2. Detect all open system services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet, NETCONF)
# 3. Verify firewall filters are applied on interfaces
# 4. Validate each open service port is protected by firewall filter with discard rules
# 5. Ensure allow rules exist for authorized source IPs
#
# STRICT VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
# - Limit access to declared IPs in access-list for remote device access via SSH
# - All open services must be protected by firewall filter with discard rules
# - Firewall filter must contain source-based allow rules with accept action
# - Firewall filter must be applied on interface
# - Must have discard rules for destination ports corresponding to open system services
#
# SAMPLE CONFIGURATION:
# set interfaces vme unit 0 family inet filter input limit-mgmt-access
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term allow-manager from source-prefix-list manager-ip
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term allow-manager then accept
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager from destination-port https
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager from destination-port telnet
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager from destination-port http
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager from destination-port 830
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager from destination-port ssh
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term block_non_manager then discard
# set firewall family inet filter limit-mgmt-access term accept_everything_else then accept
#
# USAGE:
# ./8004.sh <config_file>
#
# EXIT CODES:
# 0 - PASS: Firewall filter with source allow, accept and discard rules for corresponding open services, applied on interface
# 1 - FAILED: Missing or incorrect firewall filter configuration

# Check Junos config: services opened must be protected by firewall filter with discard rules
# Output only PASS or FAILED
